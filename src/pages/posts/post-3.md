# Free trade and protectionism

## Free trade
Free trade takes place between countries when there are no barriers to trade in place, established by the government or international organisations.

### Arguments for protectionism

1. **Protecting domestic employment**: In the economy there will be industries that are in decline(sunset industries), due to inability to compete with foreign firms. Governments may attempt to protect these industries by introducing protectionist measures.

2. **Protecting the economy from low-cost labour**: Unemployment may occur if the low cost labour from foreign importers. This may however go against the idea of comparative advantage.

3. **Protecting an infant (sunrise) industry**: Governments may impose protectionist measures to protect newly developing industries which are not competitive enough. These sunrise industries do not yet possess economies of scale which causes them to be less competitive.

4. **To avoid risks of over-specialisation**: Governments may attempt to limit over-specialisation to avoid dependence on exports of one or two products. This lack of diversification leads to an increased risk if the world markets for these products would change.
5. **Strategic reasons**: Some argue that certain industries should be protected in case of war.

6. **To prevent dumping**: Dumping refers to a practice of selling large quantities of goods in a foreign market at a lower price than production costs. Dumping can severely negatively affect smaller producers of the country where the products are sold to (especially developing countries). This situation allows governments to introduce anti-dumping measures.

7. **To protect standards**: Countries may introduce health, environmental and safety standards for goods imported into their markets. This serves to ensure the quality of imported products matches the standards of the domestic ones.

8. **To raise government revenue**: Taxation on imports (tariffs) raise government revenue.

9. **To correct a balance of payments deficit**.


### Arguments against protectionism
1. Protectionism may raise prices to consumers and producers.
2. Less choice for consumers.
3. Less competition if foreign firms are kept away. This may create inefficiencies if domestic producers do not have the incentive to minimise costs along with lower export competitiveness.
4. Distorted comparative advantage leading to inefficient allocation of resources and lower world output.
5. Protectionism may prompt retaliation from other countries.
6. These disadvantages may overall hinder economic growth.

### Main types of protectionism
- Tariffs, which are taxes imposed on imported goods. They are the most common anti-dumping measure as they can eliminate the cost advantage of importers.
- Subsidies essentially defined as the amount of money paid by the government to a firm, per a unit of income, thus lowering the firm's costs. This action helps the firms become more competitive.
- Quotas, that are physical limits on the number or value of goods that can be imported into a country.
- Administrative barriers:
  - Red tape refers to excessive bureaucratic procedures and regulations established to restrict imports.
  - Health, safety, and environmental standards.
  - Embargoes, which are known as extreme quotas. This measure involves a complete ban on imports and is usually meant as political punishment.
