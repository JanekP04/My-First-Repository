# Introduction to Economics Review

**Economics** is a social science that studies how people interact with each other in society to overcome the problems that arise due to the basic problem of scarcity.

#### **Microeconomics vs Macroeconomics**

**Microeconomics** focuses on the interactions between smaller economic agents, such as consumers and producers, within individual markets. It examines consumer welfare and producer efficiency, as well as government intervention and producer competitiveness within specific markets.

**Macroeconomics**, on the other hand, deals with the broader economy, including issues like economic growth, income distribution, and challenges such as inflation and unemployment. It also examines the impact of policy tools like taxation and interest rates on the economy as a whole.

#### **Scarcity and Opportunity Cost**

**Scarcity** is a major issue in the world that stems from the conflict between finite resources and infinite material needs and wants. Hence within the economy all stakeholders make choices in regards to resource allocation. All decisions that economic agents make require a sacrifice thus leading to a concept known as **opportunity cost**.

*Opportunity cost* refers to the value of the alternative that is foregone when a particular economic decision is taken. It may also be called a trade-off.

Considering that scarcity is an issue the value of sustainable resource allocation rises. It means that they must be managed in a way that does not threaten the future generationâ€™s ability to use the same things. The key is to consider the matter of efficiency in the economy. The finite resources need to be managed in a way that maximizes production (highest output achievable) and minimizes waste.

#### **The Basic Economic Problems**

1. What to produce and in what amounts?
2. How to produce it?
3. For whom is it produced?

#### **Factors of Production**

1. **Land**: all resources provided by nature
2. **Labour**
3. **Capital**: physical such as factories, buildings, machines, infrastructure. When firms spend money on capital we call it investment.
4. **Entrepreneurship**: management

#### **Positive vs Normative Economics**

**Positive economics** involves describing and analyzing economic relationships through objective and factual statements, relying on logic and empirical evidence.

**Normative economics**, in contrast, involves subjective value judgments about how things ought to be (opinion based).

#### **Production Possibilities Curve (PPC)**

The diagram represents the maximum combination of two types of output that can be produced in an economy at a given time period.

**PPC Assumptions:**
1. The economy produces only two goods at a time
2. The state of resources and technology is fixed
3. All resources are fully employed

The PPC illustrates issues of scarcity, choice, opportunity cost, and efficiency. Point H shows unemployment of resources or their inefficient use. The points beneath PPC are possible but showcase inefficiency. A movement towards the PPC curve portrays actual economic growth. Point I illustrates what is impossible due to the lack of factors of production.

#### **Why is the PPC concave?**

The PPC is concave because of the concept of increasing opportunity costs. In an economy with finite resources, producing more of one good means sacrificing the production of another. As you move along the PPC, producing more of one good requires sacrificing increasing amounts of the other good. This reflects the idea of diminishing marginal returns.

#### **Growth in Production Possibilities**

If there is an improvement in the quality or quantity of factors of production, or technological advancement, then the PPC would shift outwards indicating production possibility growth. The opposite may also happen where the PPC would shift to the left as a consequence of a reduction of quantity or quality of factors of production. 

#### **Circular Flow of Income Model**

The circular flow of income model is a simplified representation of how money flows through an economy between households and firms (businesses). It illustrates the interdependence of households and firms in an economy and how they interact through the exchange of goods, services, and payments.

#### **Planned vs Free Economy**

1. **Free Market Economy**
2. **Command Economy**
3. **Mixed Economy**

In summary, free market, command, and mixed economies represent different approaches to organizing economic activity, with varying degrees of government intervention and control. Each system has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of economic system often depends on historical, cultural, and political factors.
